# About me!
Writing software is my vocation. It doesn't feel like work to me.

I’ve always been a great problem solver, inquisitive about how things work. Today, I’m a web developer and have built several projects that I invite you to explore. These projects demonstrate the type of skills I have acquired and what I can bring to your project.

In addition to my skills, I abide by three core tenants that I bring to any company, contract, or freelance opportunity.

Work Ethic - I believe a good day is a productive day. So I use my work hours to be productive. I try to bring value each and every day.

Integrity- I try to promote accountability to my self about my work quality and who I think I should be as a contributor to a project or company.

Commitment to Craft - I believe and practice constant expansion of what I know in the field of software development. I find it all fascinating and rewarding.

I’m familiar with a variety of programming technologies, including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, ASP.NET, C#, .NET, and SQL but I’m always adding new technologies to my technical stack. I’m also excited to connect with other software engineers. Feel free to connect with me!
